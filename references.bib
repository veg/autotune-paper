	abstract = {Molecular epidemiology has become a key tool for tracking infectious disease epidemics. Here, the spread of the most prevalent HIV-1 subtypes in Northern Alberta, Canada, was characterized with a Bayesian phylogenetic approach using 1146 HIV-1 pol sequences collected between 2007 and 2013 for routine clinical management purposes. Available patient metadata were qualitatively interpreted and correlated with onwards transmission using Fisher exact tests and logistic regression. Most infections were from subtypes A (n=36), B (n=815) and C (n=211). Africa is the dominant origin location for subtypes A and C while the subtype B epidemic was seeded from the USA and Middle America and, from the early 1990s onwards, mostly by interprovincial spread. Subtypes A (77.8\%) and C (74.0\%) were usually heterosexually transmitted and circulate predominantly among Blacks (61.1\% and 85\% respectively). Subtype B was mostly found among Caucasians (48.6\%) and First Nations (36.8\%), and its modes of transmission were stratified by ethnic origin. Compared to subtypes A (5.6\%) and C (3.8-10.0\%), a larger portion of subtype B patients were found within putative provincial transmission networks (20.3-29.5\%), and this almost doubled when focusing on nationwide transmission clusters (37.9-57.5\%). No clear association between cluster membership and particular patient characteristics was found. This study reveals complex and multi-faceted transmission dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in this otherwise low HIV prevalence population in Northern Alberta, Canada. These findings can aid public health planning.},

We aimed to better understand the patterns of adolescent HIV-1 acquisition, to help guide future prevention interventions. We conducted a study combining epidemiologic and HIV-1 pol sequence data from a retrospective cohort of HIV-infected adults and adolescents in Seattle, WA between 2000 and 2013. Adolescents were defined as 13-24 years of age at the time of first HIV-1 care. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were reconstructed to identify putative viral transmission clusters of two or more individuals, followed by multivariable regression tests of associations between clustering and demographic and clinical parameters. The dataset included 3,102 sequences from 1,953 individuals; 72 putative transmission clusters were identified, representing 168 individuals (8.6\%). MSM and MSM/intravenous drug use (IDU) were positively associated with clustering, with aOR 3.18 (95\% CI: 1.34-7.55) and 2.59 (95\% CI: 1.04-6.49), respectively. African American race was negatively associated with clustering (aOR 0.54 95\% CI: 0.32-0.91). Twenty-five clusters contained one adolescent and five clusters contained two adolescents. Other individuals who clustered with adolescents were predominantly male (95\%), white (85\%), and either MSM (66\%) or MSM/IDU (16\%), with a greater mean age (34 years vs. 22 years; p {\textless} .01). In this Seattle cohort, HIV-1 transmission linkages were identified between white male adolescents and older MSM adults. Interventions aimed at age-discrepant pairs may reduce HIV-1 infections in adolescent males.},

Traditional 'shoe-leather' epidemiology infers transmission clusters by tracing chains of partners sharing epidemiological connections (e.g., sexual contact). Here, we present a computational tool for identifying a molecular transmission analog of such clusters: HIV-TRACE (TRAnsmission Cluster Engine). HIV-TRACE implements an approach inspired by traditional epidemiology, by identifying chains of partners whose viral genetic relatedness imply direct or indirect epidemiological connections. Molecular transmission clusters are constructed using codon-aware pairwise alignment to a reference sequence followed by pairwise genetic distance estimation among all sequences. This approach is computationally tractable and is capable of identifying HIV-1 transmission clusters in large surveillance databases comprising tens or hundreds of thousands of sequences in near real time, that is, on the order of minutes to hours. HIV-TRACE is available at www.hivtrace.org and from www.github.com/veg/hivtrace, along with the accompanying result visualization module from www.github.com/veg/hivtrace-viz. Importantly, the approach underlying HIV-TRACE is not limited to the study of HIV-1 and can be applied to study outbreaks and epidemics of other rapidly evolving pathogens.},

However, epidemiologic relationships inferred from analysis of the V3 region of the env gene were less conclusive, especially when the V3 loop was taken in isolation.

	abstract = {We aimed to elucidate the characteristics of HIV molecular epidemiology and identify transmission hubs in eastern China using genetic transmission network and lineage analyses. HIV-TRACE was used to infer putative relationships. Across the range of epidemiologically-plausible genetic distance (GD) thresholds (0.1–2.0\%), a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the optimal threshold, generating the maximum number of transmission clusters and providing reliable resolution without merging different small clusters into a single large cluster. Characteristics of genetically linked individuals were analyzed using logistic regression. Assortativity (shared characteristics) analysis was performed to infer shared attributes between putative partners. 1,993 persons living with HIV-1 were enrolled. The determined GD thresholds within subtypes CRF07\_BC, CRF01\_AE, and B were 0.5\%, 1.2\%, and 1.7\%, respectively, and 826 of 1,993 (41.4\%) sequences were linked with at least one other sequence, forming 188 transmission clusters of 2–80 sequences. Clustering rates for the main subtypes CRF01\_AE, CRF07\_BC, and B were 50.9\% (523/1027), 34.2\% (256/749), and 32.1\% (25/78), respectively. Median cluster sizes of these subtypes were 2 (2–52, n = 523), 2 (2–80, n = 256), and 3 (2–6, n = 25), respectively. Subtypes in individuals diagnosed and residing in Hangzhou city (OR = 1.423, 95\% CI: 1.168–1.734) and men who have sex with men (MSM) were more likely to cluster. Assortativity analysis revealed individuals were more likely to be genetically linked to individuals from the same age group (AIage = 0.090, P{\textless}0.001) and the same area of residency in Zhejiang (AIcity = 0.078, P{\textless}0.001). Additionally, students living with HIV were more likely to be linked with students than show a random distribution (AI student = 0.740, P{\textless}0.01). These results highlight the importance of Hangzhou City in the regional epidemic and show that MSM comprise the population rapidly transmitting HIV in Zhejiang Province. We also provide a molecular epidemiology framework for improving our understanding of HIV transmission dynamics in eastern China.},

In Quebec, molecular network analyses tracked HIV transmission dynamics from 2002-2020 using MEGA10-Neighbour-joining, HIV-TRACE, and MicrobeTrace methodologies. Phylogenetics revealed three patterns of viral spread among Men having Sex with Men (MSM, n = 5024) and heterosexuals (HET, n = 1345) harbouring subtype B epidemics as well as B and non-B subtype epidemics (n = 1848) introduced through migration. Notably, half of new subtype B infections amongst MSM and HET segregating as solitary transmissions or small cluster networks (2-5 members) declined by 70\% from 2006-2020, concomitant to advances in treatment-as-prevention. Nonetheless, subtype B epidemic control amongst MSM was thwarted by the ongoing genesis and expansion of super-spreader large cluster variants leading to micro-epidemics, averaging 49 members/cluster at the end of 2020. The growth of large clusters was related to forward transmission cascades of untreated early-stage infections, younger at-risk populations, more transmissible/replicative-competent strains, and changing demographics. Subtype B and non-B subtype infections introduced through recent migration now surpass the domestic epidemic amongst MSM. Phylodynamics can assist in predicting and responding to active, recurrent, and newly emergent large cluster networks, as well as the cryptic spread of HIV introduced through migration.},

	abstract = {HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) and Cluster Picker are some of the most widely used programs for identifying HIV-1 transmission networks from nucleotide sequences. However, choosing between these tools is subjective and often a matter of personal preference. Because these software use different algorithms to detect HIV-1 transmission networks, their optimal use is better suited with different sequence data sets and under different scenarios. The performance of these tools has previously been evaluated across a range of genetic distance thresholds without an assessment of the differences in the structure of networks identified. In this study, we tested both programs on the same HIV-1 pol sequence data set (n = 2,017) from three Ugandan populations to examine their performance across different risk groups and evaluate the structure of networks identified. HIV-TRACE that uses a single-linkage algorithm identified more nodes in the same networks that were connected by sparse links than Cluster Picker. This suggests that the choice of the program used for identifying networks should depend on the study aims, the characteristics of the population being investigated, dynamics of the epidemic, sampling design, and the nature of research questions being addressed for optimum results. HIV-TRACE could be more applicable with larger data sets where the aim is to identify larger clusters that represent distinct transmission chains and in more diverse populations where infection has occurred over a period of time. In contrast, Cluster Picker is applicable in situations where more closely connected clusters are expected in the studied populations.},

However, some MSM do not disclose their same-sex behavior and could impact the transmission and prevention of HIV-1 infection. Here, we evaluated the role of nondisclosed MSM in HIV-1 transmission in Guangzhou, China.
METHODS: The HIV-1 pol sequences were obtained from HIV-infected subjects from 2008 to 2015. A transmission network was constructed using HIV TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) at a pairwise genetic distance of 0.5\%. The position of nondisclosed MSM in the network was determined by centrality analysis.
RESULTS: Nondisclosed MSM were inferred in 9.92\% (61 of 615) of slightly older, self-reported non-MSM (P = .006). They were more likely to be married (P = .002) and less educated (P {\textless} .001) than the MSM with whom they clustered. Closeness centrality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (P {\textless} .001), indicating the central position of nondisclosed MSM in the networks. The average shortest path length was smaller for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM (P {\textless} .001), whereas radiality was bigger for nondisclosed MSM than for MSM, suggesting a relatively greater contribution of nondisclosed MSM in transmitting HIV-1 than MSM. Assortativity analysis indicated that nondisclosed MSM were more likely to link each other with coefficient of 0.025.
CONCLUSIONS: Nondisclosed MSM are a specific group, and they play an important role in HIV-1 transmission. They could be bisexual and might increase the risk of HIV-1 infection to their sex partners. Therefore, specific prevention and intervention targeting nondisclosed MSM are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {Genetic clustering is a popular method for characterizing variation in transmission rates for rapidly evolving viruses, and could potentially be used to detect outbreaks in 'near real time'. However, the statistical properties of clustering are poorly understood in this context, and there are no objective guidelines for setting clustering criteria. Here, we develop a new statistical framework to optimize a genetic clustering method based on the ability to forecast new cases. We analysed the pairwise Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances for anonymized HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences from Seattle (n = 1,653) and Middle Tennessee, USA (n = 2,779), and northern Alberta, Canada (n = 809). Under varying TN93 thresholds, we fit two models to the distributions of new cases relative to clusters of known cases: 1, a null model that assumes cluster growth is strictly proportional to cluster size, i.e. no variation in transmission rates among individuals; and 2, a weighted model that incorporates individual-level covariates, such as recency of diagnosis. The optimal threshold maximizes the difference in information loss between models, where covariates are used most effectively. Optimal TN93 thresholds varied substantially between data sets, e.g. 0.0104 in Alberta and 0.016 in Seattle and Tennessee, such that the optimum for one population would potentially misdirect prevention efforts in another. For a given population, the range of thresholds where the weighted model conferred greater predictive accuracy tended to be narrow (±0.005 units), and the optimal threshold tended to be stable over time. Our framework also indicated that variation in the recency of HIV diagnosis among clusters was significantly more predictive of new cases than sample collection dates (ΔAIC {\textgreater} 50). These results suggest that one cannot rely on historical precedence or convention to configure genetic clustering methods for public health applications, especially when translating methods between settings of low-level and generalized epidemics. Our framework not only enables investigators to calibrate a clustering method to a specific public health setting, but also provides a variable selection procedure to evaluate different predictive models of cluster growth.},

We collected demographic and clinical data of 2221 treatment-naïve HIV-1-infected patients in a long-term cohort in Shenyang, Northeast China, between 2008 and 2016. HIV pol gene sequencing was performed and molecular networks of CRF01\_AE, CRF07\_BC, and subtype B were inferred using HIV-TRACE with separate optimized genetic distance threshold. We identified 168 clusters containing ≥ 2 cases among CRF01\_AE-, CRF07\_BC-, and subtype B-infected cases, including 13 large clusters (≥ 10 cases). Individuals in large clusters were characterized by younger age, homosexual behavior, more recent infection, higher CD4 counts, and delayed/no ART (P {\textless} 0.001). The dynamics of large clusters were estimated by proportional detection rate (PDR), cluster growth predictor, and effective reproductive number (R e ). Most large clusters showed decreased or stable during the study period, indicating that expansion was slowing. The proportion of newly diagnosed cases in large clusters declined from 30 to 8\% between 2008 and 2016, coinciding with an increase in early ART within 6 months after diagnosis from 24 to 79\%, supporting the effectiveness of strengthened early ART and continuous regular interventions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent advances in high-throughput molecular epidemiology are transforming the analysis of viral infections.
METHODS: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 pol sequences from a Northern Californian cohort (NCC) of 4553 antiretroviral-naive individuals sampled between 1998 and 2016 were analyzed together with 140 000 previously published global pol sequences. The HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE) was used to infer a transmission network comprising links between NCC and previously published sequences having a genetic distance ≤1.5\%.
RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of NCC sequences were included in 264 clusters linked to a published sequence, and approximately one third of these (8.0\% of the total) were linked to 1 or more non-US sequences. The largest cluster, containing 512 NCC sequences (11.2\% of the total), comprised the subtype B lineage that traced its origin to the earliest North American sequences. Approximately 5 percent of NCC sequences belonged to a non-B subtype, and these were more likely to cluster with a non-US sequence. Twenty-two NCC sequences belonged to 1 of 4 large clusters containing sequences from rapidly growing regional epidemics: CRF07\_BC (East Asia), subtype A6 (former Soviet Union), a Japanese subtype B lineage, and an East/Southeast Asian CRF01\_AE lineage. Bayesian phylogenetics suggested that most non-B sequences resulted from separate introductions but that local spread within the largest CRF01\_AE cluster occurred twice.
CONCLUSIONS: The NCC contains national and international links to previously published sequences including many to the subtype B strain that originated in North America and several to rapidly growing Asian epidemics. Despite their rapid regional growth, the Asian epidemic strains demonstrated limited NCC spread.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Africa has one of the highest rates of HIV-1 (HIV) infection world-wide, with the highest rates among young women. We analyzed the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary history of HIV in young women attending high school in rural South Africa.
METHODS: Samples were obtained from the HPTN 068 randomized controlled trial, which evaluated the effect of cash transfers for school attendance on HIV incidence in women aged 13-20 years (Mpumalanga province, 2011-2015). Plasma samples from HIV-infected participants were analyzed using the ViroSeq HIV-1 Genotyping assay. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using 200 pol gene study sequences and 2,294 subtype C reference sequences from South Africa. Transmission clusters were identified using Cluster Picker and HIV-TRACE, and were characterized using demographic and other epidemiological data. Phylodynamic analyses were performed using the BEAST software.
RESULTS: The study enrolled 2,533 young women who were followed through their expected high school graduation date (main study); some participants had a post-study assessment (follow-up study). Two-hundred-twelve of 2,533 enrolled young women had HIV infection. HIV pol sequences were obtained for 94\% (n = 201/212) of the HIV-infected participants. All but one of the sequences were HIV-1 subtype C; the non-C subtype sequence was excluded from further analysis. Median pairwise genetic distance between the subtype C sequences was 6.4\% (IQR: 5.6-7.2). Overall, 26\% of study sequences fell into 21 phylogenetic clusters with 2-6 women per cluster. Thirteen (62\%) clusters included women who were HIV-infected at enrollment. Clustering was not associated with study arm, demographic or other epidemiological factors. The estimated date of origin of HIV subtype C in the study population was 1958 (95\% highest posterior density [HPD]: 1931-1980), and the median estimated substitution rate among study pol sequences was 1.98x10-3 (95\% HPD: 1.15x10-3-2.81x10-3) per site per year.
CONCLUSIONS: Phylogenetic analysis suggests that multiple HIV subtype C sublineages circulate among school age girls in South Africa. There were no substantive differences in the molecular epidemiology of HIV between control and intervention arms in the HPTN 068 trial.},

	abstract = {The HIV epidemic in San Mateo County is sustained by multiple overlapping risk groups and is an important hub for HIV transmission in northern California. Limited access to care has led historically to delayed clinical presentation, higher rates of opportunistic infections, and an increased prevalence of antiretroviral drug resistance. The virologic and clinical consequences of treatment within these multiple ethnic and behavioral groups are poorly understood, highlighting the need for efficient surveillance strategies that are able to elucidate transmission networks and drug resistance patterns. We obtained sequence data from a group of 316 HIV-positive individuals in the San Mateo AIDS Program over a 14-year period and integrated epidemiologic, phylogenetic, and network approaches to characterize transmission clusters, risk factors and drug resistance. Drug resistance mutations were identified using the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in RAxML and subjected to clustering analysis in Cluster Picker. Network analysis using pairwise genetic distances was performed in HIV-TRACE. Participants were primarily male (60\%), white Hispanics and non-Hispanics (32\%) and African American (20.6\%). The most frequent behavior risk factor was male-male sex (33.5\%), followed by heterosexual (23.4\%) and injection drug use (9.5\%). Nearly all sequences were subtype B (96\%) with subtypes A, C, and CRF01\_AE also observed. Sequences from 65\% of participants had at least one drug resistance mutation. Clustered transmissions included a higher number of women when compared to non-clustered individuals and were more likely to include heterosexual or people who inject drugs (PWID). Detailed analysis of the largest network (N = 47) suggested that PWID played a central role in overall transmission of HIV-1 as well as bridging men who have sex with men (MSM) transmission with heterosexual/PWID among primarily African American men. Combined phylogenetic and network analysis of HIV sequence data identified several overlapping risk factors in the epidemic, including MSM, heterosexual and PWID transmission with a disproportionate impact on African Americans and a high prevalence of drug resistance.},
