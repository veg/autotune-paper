data cruncher vs data generator

developes around Slide 2 or 3

I liked the messy road at the beginning

I liked the energy, it made the talk high engaging.

There was a really nice story within project 1. 

I think having a way to tie in the projects into an overarching theme might be easy to do and make the talk even more engaging.

Perhaps spend more time discussing the mutations, where they are, and the structure more slowly

There's a bit of a lack of discussion in the actual methods.
