### HIV-1 pol sequence data

Each directory contains all (unaligned) HIV-1 pol sequences as a `FASTA` file associated with a particular paper as `sequence.fasta`. Typically those were retrieved by using GenBank accession numbers in each paper. We also examined GenBank PopSets associated with the sequences because sometimes those contained more submitted data that given by the published accesstion numbers.

The name of the directory is formatted as `FirstAuthorLastName-Year-PUBMED ID`
